# albumer

albumer is a SPA meant to make it easier to remember just what album your friends recommended you. In albumer you can easily add, remove and mark albums as listened.

<br />

## How does albumer work?

albumer was built using Vue.js with Vuex and Vue-router. It also uses firebase to handle database and login stuff. We also use [element.io](https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US) for some basic UI componenets such as buttons and input fields somewhere.

<br />

## Who will use this?

Anyone who has an interest in listening to new music, but finds the management of having to remember what albums to listen to hard!
